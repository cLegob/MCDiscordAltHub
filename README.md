# MCDiscordAltHub
A way to link your alts to a discord channel. Run the script on something like a raspberry pi and you can control your alt's chat, and weather they are online or offline.  

this is all possible because of mineflayer (https://github.com/PrismarineJS/mineflayer)  

# Setup
make sure you have node.js + npm installed.  

npm install mineflayer  
npm install discord.js  
npm install dotenv  

rename env.txt to just .env  
fill in the missing information inside index.js and inside .env
